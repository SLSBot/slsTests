# This SLS file is used to update the minion configuration file on a Salt minion.
# It uses the "file.replace" state to replace a specific line in the minion configuration file with a new line containing multiple master server addresses.

# The "file.replace" state is used to modify a file on the minion. It takes in several parameters to specify the file to be modified, the pattern to be replaced, and the replacement text.

# The "name" parameter specifies the path of the file to be modified, in this case it is the minion configuration file located at "/etc/salt/minion".

# The "pattern" parameter specifies the regular expression pattern to be matched in the file. In this case, it is the line that starts with "master: ", followed by any number of characters (represented by ".*"), and ending with the end of the line (represented by "$").

# The "repl" parameter specifies the replacement text. In this case, it uses the "|" character to denote a multiline replacement, and the "master:" line is replaced with a new line containing two master server addresses, "master1.example.com" and "master2.example.com".

# The "backup" parameter specifies the extension to be added to the original file when creating a backup. In this case, the original minion configuration file will be backed up with the ".bak" extension.

# The "show_changes" parameter is set to True, which will display the changes made to the file in the Salt minion's output.
